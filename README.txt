This directory contains intra- and inter-genus alignments in fasta or phylip format and associated phylogenies in newick format, keys to interpret cluster numbers and IDs used in gene phylogenies, phylogenetic concordance pipeline, and custom python scripts used in SNP by SNP analyses. Species are labeled using IDs (see ~/Keys/Appendix_1.xlsx for ID to species key) and genes are labeled using cluster numbers or gene names when applicable (see ~/Keys/Appendix_2.xlsx for cluster number to gene key).
